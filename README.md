## Server-Client File Transfer Program

Instructions:
- Clone repo to your computer.
- In the directory you downloaded the files, open two Linux terminals(one for the client and the other for the server).
- First, run `gcc client.c -o client`, then `gcc server.c -o server` to compile the files.
- In one of the terminal, run `./server PORTNUMBER` (could be any port number,for e.g. 5000).
- Then, in the other terminal, run `./client 127.0.0.1 PORTNUMBER FILE1 FILE2`.
    - 127.0.0.1 is used as the loopback address here but it could be any other server.
    - FILE1 is existing path on server and FILE2 is targeted path on the client's side which in this case is the current working directory.
